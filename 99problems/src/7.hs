{- 

(**) Flatten a nested list structure.
 
Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat' list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).

Example:

* (my-flatten '(a (b (c d) e)))
(A B C D E)
Example in Haskell:

We have to define a new data type, because lists in Haskell are homogeneous.

λ> flatten (Elem 5)
[5]
λ> flatten (List [Elem 1, List [Elem 2, List [Elem 3, Elem 4], Elem 5]])
[1,2,3,4,5]
λ> flatten (List [])
[]

data NestedList a = Elem a | List [NestedList a]

flatten :: NestedList a -> [a]
flatten (Elem x) = [x]
flatten (List (x:xs)) = flatten x ++ flatten (List xs)
flatten (List []) = []
